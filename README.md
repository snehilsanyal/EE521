Submissions have to be done here at `assignments` branch in respective folder. Kindly stay updated with the slack channel and the Microsoft teams group. 

__Important:__

- Fork the updated repo.
- Navigate to the `assignments` branch.
- Create a folder named `RollNumber_Name` for example `196102013_SnehilSanyal`. (Please write the full name and dont mess up the structure)
- Put all your scripts inside the folder. Dont put any other useless stuff anywhere else. It saves time for both of us to make submissions and review.
- Make a Pull request from your `assignments` branch to our `assignments` branch.
- Wait for your code to be reviewed and merged to the repo. You will be told about issues if any in your code via DM and issues of GitHub.
