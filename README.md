## Welcome to EE521 (Jan-May 2021)

### [Final submission for Projects: ]()
### [Viva Examination:]()
### [Important Notice: Hands on sessions will be held once students reach back to campus by April 2021]()

Hello friends... Its our second time together. I hope you are safe and sound. It was a great experience for me last semester when we conducted the **[EE524 Machine Learning Lab](https://snehilsanyal.github.io/EE524/)**. I got to meet talented students like you and I really liked teaching you a lot. This semester let us keep up the tempo and enthusiasm and learn new things.

I hope you are all excited to learn about Digital Signal Processors. This course is closely based on the theory course **EE520 Signal Processing Algorithms and Architectures**. This lab is offerred by Professor [Manas Kamal Bhuyan](https://www.iitg.ac.in/mkb/) sir. We will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) an open source software to run our codes. We will also use [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for implementing and visualizing different filters.

### Objectives of this lab:

1. Familiarize with basic concepts of Signals and Systems and Probability with visualizations.
2. Learn about the concepts in Digital Signal Processing from basic operations, transforms, system implementation and filter design. 
3. Learn about different algorithms in Digital Signal Processing.
4. Apply these concepts in different digital signals like images and speech.
5. Create something as an outcome of this lab course.

### Lab evaluation Structure:

- **Continuous Evaluations:** 50 Marks (Through Assignments)
- **Viva:** 20 Marks (After all submissions)
- **Mini Project:** 30 Marks (Will be given before 6th Lab Session)


### Topics to be covered

Some topics that will be covered in this lab are given: Basics of Signals and Systems, Probability, Time domain and frequencey domain analysis, Magnitude and argument spectrum, Fourier, Laplace and Z Transforms, DFT, DCT, DST, FFT, Filter design, DF-1 and DF-2, FIR and IIR filters.


### Timeline:

We have a total of 14 labs in this session. Everything will be online due to the pandemic. We will be pushing assignments, have doubt sessions and will evaluate your assignments. Assignments will be released weekly.
