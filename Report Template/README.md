# Instructions for using the template

- Download the rar file from the slack workspace or from the repo [here](./Report Template/)
- Extract the folder and upload to Overleaf
- Use the separate files for abstract, literature, conclusions and so on. Make changes related to abstract only in the abstract.tex file.
- To see the changes compile the main.tex file. This file takes input from different tex files so no need to change the main file. 
- Finally download the report and submit before the deadline and upload to the project folder
